## The GitHub History of the Scala Language
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. </br>
In this project, we will be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). </br>
With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. </br>
You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts. </br>

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
